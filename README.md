## Installation

Using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/):

```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod 'WCCircularFloatingActionMenu'
```

## Usage

1. Add a UIButton in the storyboards.
2. Change the button's class to WCCircularFloatingActionMenu
3. Set the datasource and delegate (e.g. your view controller)
4. Conform to the protocols in a similar way you would to a UITableView
5. You may change positioning and animation properties in the UIBuilder itself

## Notes

1. A full demo is included in the source code
2. We're pretty much open to any suggestions
